# ethical-hacking-ceh--TechSnippy
We are going to be using a lot of ethical hacking tools in this course, so to make it easy for you, we have compiled all the software, projects, and resources we use in the course into one document attached to this lecture so you can always use it as a reference and as a guide as you go along in the course. Enjoy!
