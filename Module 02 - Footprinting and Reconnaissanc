# Module 02 - Footprinting and Reconnaissance #
Footprinting (aka Reconnaissance) refers to collecting information about a target network and its environment, which is the first step in any attack on a system. It helps attackers to narrow down the scope of their efforts and aids in the selection of weapons and the strategy of the attack.

### Objectives ###
To gather:

* Organization Information - Employee details, partner details, weblinks, web technologies, patents, trademarks...
* Network Information - Domains, sub-domains, network blocks, network topologies, trusted routers, firewalls, IPs, Whois record, DNS records...
* System Information - OS, Web Servers OS, user accounts and passwords...

The tools are found at: `Module 02 Footprinting and Reconnaissance`.

## Perform Website Footprinting ##
### Ping ###
#### Resolving the IP ####
``` ping <URL> ``` 

#### Find the Maximum Frame Size on the Network ####
``` ping <URL> -f -l <Length of the Packet - Ex. 1500> ``` - Analyze the response:

  * 'Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set' -> The frame is too large to be on the network. Try again reducing the length of the packet.
  * OK -> The frame size is smaller than the limit, try increasing the length of the packet.

#### Mapping the routers between you and the target ####
``` tracert <URL> ```

``` ping <URL> -i X ``` - i is the TimeToLive value, modify it until it does not respond with 'TTL expired in transit'.

## Perform Footprinting using Various Footprinting Tools ##
### Recon-ng ###
Web reconnaissance framework with independent modules and database interaction that provides an environment to perform web-based reconnaissance.

* Network Reconnaissance:
  ```
  recon-ng
  > help
  > marketplace install all (To install all modules)
  > modules search
  > workspaces 
  > workspaces create CEH
  > workspaces list
  > db insert domains
   > domain: <desired domain>
   > notes: <any notes>
  > show domains
  > modules load brute (To look for modules that contain 'brute')
  > modules load recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts (To harvest hosts-related information)
  > run
  ```

  Other modules such as Netcraft or Bing can be used to harvest more hosts:
  ```
  > back
  > modules load recon/domains-hosts/bing_domain_web
  > run
  ```

  To perform a reverse lookup for each IP Address obtained during the reconnaissance:
  ```
  > back
  > modules load reverse_resolve
  > modules load recon/hosts-hosts/reverse_resolve
  > run
  > show hosts (To show all harvested hosts so far)
  ```

  To generate a report:
  ```
  > back
  > modules load reporting
  > modules load reporting/html
  > options set FILENAME <path>/results.html
  > options set CREATOR <Name>
  > options set CUSTOMER <Domain Name / Name of the Client>
  > run
  ```

* Gather Personnel Information
  To obtain the contacts related to the domains:
  ```
  recon-ng
  > workspaces create reconnaissance
  > modules load recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
  > info
  > options set SOURCE facebook.com (Sets facebook.com as the target domain)
  ```
  
  Validate the existence of usernames on specific websites:
