# Module 05 - Vulnerability Analysis #
Vulnerability assessment is an examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand an assault. Vulnerability research is the process of discovering vulnerabilities and design flaws that leave an OS and its applications open to attack or misuse. To secure a network, an administrator needs to perform patch management, install proper AV software, check configurations, solve known issures in third-party applications, and troubleshoot hardware with default configurations.

## Perform Vulnerability Research with Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases ##
### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ###
CWE is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It can be employed as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation and prevention.

It can be found at: https://cwe.mitre.org/.

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ###
CVE is a list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. It is used to discuss or share information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability, provides a baseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation.

It can be found at: https://cve.mitre.org/.

### National Vulnerability Database (NVD) ###
NVD is the US government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). These data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names and impact metrics.

It can be found at: https://nvd.nist.gov/.


## Perform Vulnerability Assessment using Various Vulnerability Assessment Tools ##
Vulnerability assessment tools are used to secure and protect the organization's system or network: security analysts can use these tools to identify weaknesses and remediate them before they get exploited by an attacker.

### OpenVAS ###
OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high-level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implment any vulnerability test.

It can be found on the Parrot machine under `Applications > Pentesting > Vulnerability Analysis > OpenVAS - Greenbone`.

To start scanning a target: `Scans > Tasks > *Purple Wand Icon* > Task Wizard` 

### Nessus ###
Nessus is an assessment solution for identifying vulnerabilities, configuration issues and malware, which can be used to penetrate networks. It performs vulnerability, configuration and compliance assessment.

It can be found at: `Module 05 Vulnerability Analysis\Vulnerability Assessment Tools\`.

`Policies > Advanced Scan` - Create a policy to scan hosts

`My Scans > Create a new scan > User Defined > *Select the created policy*`

### GFI LanGuard ###
Similar to Nessus, it scans networks and ports to detect, assess, and correct any security vulnerabilities found.


### Nikto ###
Nikto Web Scanner is a Web Server scanner that tests for dangerous file/CGIs, outdated server software, bad header configuration...
