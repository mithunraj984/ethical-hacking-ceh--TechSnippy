# Module 07 - Malware Threats #

## Gain Access to the Target System using Trojans ##

### Gaining Control ###
#### njRAT ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Trojans Types\Remote Access Trojans (RAT)\`.

``` njRAT v0.7d.exe ``` > Select port and start
  * Builder > Host:<Victim IP>, and select 'Copy to StartUp' and 'Registry StartUp' > 'Build' - Creates a 'Server.exe' file
  
In the victim machine: Copy the 'Server.exe' file to the Desktop and open it. It can access a victim's camera, log keystrokes, steal credentials stored in browsers, upload and download files, perform process and file manipulations, viewing the desktop...


### Obfuscating a Trojan ###
#### SwayzCryptor ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Crypters\`.

``` swayzcryptor.exe ``` 
  * File -> The njRat 'Server.exe' created file
  * Select: Start Up, Mutex and Disable UAC
  * Encrypt (CryptedFile.exe)

In the victim machine: Copy the 'CryptedFile.exe' file to the Desktop and open it.


### Creating a Server ###
#### ProRat Tool ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Trojans Types\Remote Access Trojans (RAT)\`.

``` ProRat.exe ``` > 'Create ProRat Server (342 Kbayt)' > In 'General Settings' leave the default Settings but unselect all the ticks minus the ones in 'Invisibility' > Bind with File (Select an image)

In the victim machine: Run 'binded_server.exe'. It will turn into a .jpg.
In the attacker machine: Type the victim IP and port (default) and 'Connect'


### Creating a Trojan Server ###
#### Theef RAT Trojan ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Trojans Types\Remote Access Trojans (RAT)\`.

In the victim machine: ``` Server210.exe ```
In the attacker machine: ``` Client210.exe ``` > Type the victim IP and 'Connect' (leave the default ports)

#### GUI Trojan MoSucker ####
``` CreateServer.exe ``` > Default settings and save it as _'server.exe'_ and remember the port that was set
``` MoSucker.exe ``` > Type the IP of the victim and the port that was set in the previous step

In the victim machine, open ``` server.exe ```, and then on the attacker machine, in MoSucker click on 'Connect'.


### Creating and Remotely Controlling an HTTP Trojan ###
#### HTTP RAT ####
In one machine (the attacker): ``` httprat.exe ``` > Set the port to the desired one
In another machine (the victim): ``` httpserver.exe ``` - It will run on the background

## Perform Static Malware Analysis ##
Static Malware Analysis, also known as code analysis, involves going through the executable binary code without executing it to gain a better understanding of the malware and its purpose.

### Online Malware Scanning ###
#### VirusTotal ####
http://www.virustotal.com/. VirusTotal aims to improve the AV and security industry and make the Internet a safer place through the development of free tools and services. It simply acts as an information aggregator. The aggregated data are the output of different AV engines, website scanners, file and URL analysis tools, and user contributions.

#### Other Local and Online Malware Scanning Tools ####
* Hybrid Analysis (https://www.hybrid-analysis.com)
* Cuckoo Sandbox (https://cuckoosandbox.org)
* Jotti (https://virusscan.jotti.org)
* Valkyrie Sandbox (https://valkyrie.comodo.com)


### Strings Search ###
Various strings that could represent the malicious intent of a program, such as reading the internal memory or cookie data, are embedded in the compiled binary code.

#### BinText ####
It is a text extractor than can extract text from any file. It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static Malware Analysis Tools\String Searching Tools\`.

Browse the file, select 'Advanced View' and click 'Go'.

#### Other String Searching Tools ####
* FLOSS (https://www.fireeye.com)
* Strings (https://docs.microsoft.com)
* Free EXE DLL Resource Extract (http://www.resourceextract.com)
* FileSeek (https://www.fileseek.ca)


### Identify Packaging and Obfuscation Methods ###
#### PEid ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static Malware Analysis Tools\Packaging and Obfuscation Tools\`.

#### Other Packaging and Obfuscation Tools ####
* Macro_Pack (GitHub)
* UPX (https://upx.github.io)
* ASPack (http://www.aspack.com)


### Find the Portable Executable (PE) Information of a Malware Executable File ###
The Portable Executable (PE) format is the executable file format used on Windows OS that stores the information a Windows system requires to manage the executable code. The PE stores metadata about the program, which helps in finding additional details of the file. For instance, the Windows binary is in PE format that consists of information such as time of creation and modification, import and export functions, compilation time, DLLs and linked files, as well as strings, menus and symbols.

#### PE Explorer ####
It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static Malware Analysis Tools\PE Extraction Tools\`.

'File' > 'Open File'. 
* 'HEADERS INFO' (Document with Info bubble icon) - Allows you to view and save a text report on the file headers info, modify the entry point value, update the value of the checksum in the header, and set flag bits in the file header characteristics field.
* 'DATA DIRECTORIES' (Sublist icon next to the previous one) - Ability to view and edit the virtual address and size of the chosen directory.
* 'SECTION HEADERS' (Document with sublist icon) - View all sections and information about their location and size. Double click on a section to view the raw content.

#### Other PE Extraction Tools ####
* Portable Executable Scanner (pescan - https://tzworks.net)
* Resource Hacker (http://www.angusj.com)
* PEView (https://www.aldeid.com)


### Identify File Dependencies ###
#### Dependency Walker ####
It lists all dependent modules of an executable file and builds hierarchical tree diagrams. It also records all functions that each module exports and calls. Furthermore, it detects many common application problems such as missing and invalid modules, import and export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine modules, and module initialization failures.

It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static Malware Analysis Tools\File Dependency Tools\`.

#### Other Depdendency Checking Tools ####
* Dependency-check (https://jeremylong.github.io)
* Snyk (https://snyk.io)
* Hakiri (https://hakiri.io)
* RetireJS (https://retirejs.github.io)


### Perform Malware Disassembly ###
#### IDA Pro ####
It's a disassembler: It explores binary programs, for which the source code might not be available, to create maps of their execution. The primary purpose of a disassembler is to display the instructions actually executed by the processor in a symbolic representation called 'assembly language'. The debugger in IDA complements the static analysis capabilities of the disassembler. By allowing an analyst to single-step through the code being investigated, the debugger often bypasses the obfuscation.

It can be found at: `Module 07 Malware Threats\Malware Analysis Tools\Static Malware Analysis Tools\Disassembling and Debugging Tools\`.

* View > Graphs > Flow Chart - The flow of the application
* HEX
* Structures
